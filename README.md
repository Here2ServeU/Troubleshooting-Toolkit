# DevOps Troubleshooting Toolkit

A curated, category-based collection of the **most common bottlenecks** DevOps teams face across the stack. This toolkit helps you rapidly diagnose and fix problems so your team can spend less time firefighting and more time delivering value.

## What You'll Find Inside

Each directory focuses on a different domain of modern DevOps:

- **Cloud** — AWS, GCP, Azure-related failures and misconfigurations  
- **Containers** — Docker and OCI runtime issues  
- **Databases** — PostgreSQL, MySQL, and other DB bottlenecks  
- **Kubernetes** — Troubleshooting pods, nodes, and clusters  
- **Terraform** — State issues, provider problems, and Infrastructure as Code best practices  
- **Linux** — System-level diagnostics for on-prem or cloud VMs  
- **Observability** — Monitoring, metrics, logs, and alerting errors  
- **Scripts** — Automation scripts to quickly resolve or detect problems

---

## Why Use This?

When systems break, engineers scramble. This toolkit exists to:

- Speed up root cause analysis  
- Reduce mean time to resolution (MTTR)  
- Enable proactive monitoring  
- Share tribal knowledge  
- Help you focus on what really matters: your mission

Whether you’re a solo SRE or part of a platform team, this toolkit will give you the clarity and tools to debug with confidence.
